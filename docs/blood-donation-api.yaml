  description: |
    Comprehensive API documentation for Blood Donation Management System.
    
    ## Role-Based Access Control
    - Admin: System-wide access and management
    - Manager: Facility-specific donation management and analytics
    - Doctor: Blood donation review, division management, and QR scanning
    - Nurse: Donation creation, updates, QR scanning, and workflow management
    - Member: Personal donation history access
    
    ## Blood Donation Workflow
    1. **Registration**: User creates blood donation registration
    2. **Health Check**: Doctor performs health assessment
    3. **Donation Creation**: Nurse creates blood donation record
    4. **Donation Process**: Nurse manages donation workflow (donating → completed/cancelled)
    5. **Post-Donation**: Transition to resting phase
    6. **Blood Processing**: Doctor marks blood as divided for component separation
    
    ## QR Code Integration
    - **Nurse QR Scan**: Access donation details and workflow management
    - **Doctor Access**: Review donations assigned to them
    - **Facility Isolation**: Staff can only access donations from their facility
    
    ## Authentication
    All endpoints require authentication via Bearer token in Authorization header.
